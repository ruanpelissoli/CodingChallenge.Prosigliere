# CodingChallenge.Prosigliere

**THIS PROJECT IS OVER ENGINEERED FOR THE PURPOSE OF DEMONSTRATING MY SKILLS**

I know this project has a small scope, but I wanted to demonstrate my skills in a more complex project and I hope this does not backfires. Have fun.

Steps to run the project:

1. Clone the repository
2. cd into the project folder
3. Run `docker-compose up` command to start the containers
4. At this point we should have the api, redis and postgresql running
5. Access the application at `http://localhost:5029/swagger/index.html`
6. It is also possible to make http calls from BloggingPlatform.API.http file inside the project BloggingPlatform.API

TODOs if I had more time:
- Add Users
- Authentication
- Authorization
- Auditable Entities
- Configure CORS
- Add message queue with mass transit and rabbitmq
- Integration tests
- CI/CD files

If you have any questions, let me know.
